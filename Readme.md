## Overview

SavvyCircle aims to address the financial inclusion challenges faced by small business owners in Africa. By utilizing smart contracts on the blockchain, we've created a platform that allows users to form savings groups, contribute funds, and access loans in a transparent and automated manner.

## Features

- **ROSCA as a Service**: Members can easily create and manage saving groups on Telegram through the SavvyCircle bot. The platform enables seamless savings, lending, and borrowing within a trusted, decentralized framework.
- **Automated Loan Distribution**: Using Chainlink Automation, the system ensures timely and fair loan distribution, reducing the reliance on centralized intermediaries.
- **Telegram Integration**: Groups can manage their savings and lending operations directly through the Telegram app, creating a social experience where group communication and financial transactions are integrated.
- **Transparent Transactions**: Every transaction within the group is visible and verifiable, eliminating any concerns about mismanagement or fraud.
- **Stablecoin for Naira Pegged Transactions**: SavvyCircle introduces a stablecoin pegged to the Naira, allowing borderless payments and transactions within the platform without currency volatility.
- **Easy Web2 to Web3 Transition**: SavvyCircle offers a familiar interface via Telegram, making it simple for users who are new to blockchain to transition from traditional systems to decentralized solutions.

## Smart Contract

The core of SavvyCircle is the `SavvySavings` smart contract. Key components include:

- **ERC20 Token**: Users can deposit and withdraw tokens that represent their contributions or loans.
- **Group Management**: Smart contracts facilitate group creation, user enrollment, and contribution tracking.
- **Loan Mechanism**: Loans are automatically distributed based on preset conditions (e.g., contributions, repayment history).
- **Repayment Tracking**: The contract keeps track of outstanding loans and repayments with built-in penalties for late payments.
- **Chainlink Automation**: Automates critical processes like loan distribution to ensure no central authority is required to handle operations.

## How It Works

1. **Group Formation**: Users create or join a savings group.
2. **Regular Contributions**: Members make monthly contributions to their group's pool.
3. **Loan Distribution**:
   - When conditions are met, the contract automatically distributes loans.
   - Loans are given in two batches to ensure fairness.
4. **Repayment**: Members repay loans over a 3-month period with 5% interest.
5. **Cycle Continuation**: After full repayment, a new loan cycle can begin.
